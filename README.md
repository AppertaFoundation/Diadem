# LiveCode & OpenEHR
The DiADeM app makes use of OpenEHR and connects to it via the [libLivecodeOpenEHR](https://github.com/ApplicationInsight/lib-LiveCode-OpenEHR) developer tools.

# Update (19th September 2017)
Most of the development work has been done on the app and associated server resources, and DiADeM is now in 'open beta'. It is not yet ready to be used with real patient's data until final issues around secure hosting and information governance are finalised - but it does function

When the above issues (plus some further refinements and 'polishing') are complete the app will be released on the Apple App Store and Google Play
